# Dev-debug environment

The goal of this environment is to provide consisitent env for developers, easy to recreate and adjust.

# Users

Obviously we have root and usual user (centos or ec2-user), however main user that does debugging is hybris. Any development tools like JDK or so should be installed for this user exclusivelly.
